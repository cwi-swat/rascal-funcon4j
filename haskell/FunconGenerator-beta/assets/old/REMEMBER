* Lifting phase: adding lifted Funcons to AST, one for every operation
* Congruence phase: add congruence rules for every funcon, depending on signature
* Name of Funcon not in FunconPattern, assumed to be the same as the parent Funcons 
        (check statically at construction time)
* Write-only entities can not be updated by conditional rules (condition of refocussing)

* Is it possible to check whether rules form closure? (always one applies)
